<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">JOHN BROWN&rsquo;<sup>S</sup> RAID</span></h2>
<p>Through the gloom of the night, Sunday, October 16, 1859, a small
band of men tramped silently behind a horse-drawn wagon down a
winding Maryland road leading to Harpers Ferry, Va. From the shoulder
of each man hung loosely a Sharps rifle, hidden by long gray shawls that
protected the ghostly figures against the chilling air of approaching winter.
A slight drizzle of rain veiled the towering Blue Ridge Mountains with
an eerie mist. Not a sound broke the stillness, save the tramping feet
and the creaking wagon.</p>
<p>Side by side marched lawyer and farmer, escaped convict and pious
Quaker, Spiritualist and ex-slave, joined in common cause by a hatred of
slavery. Some had received their baptism of fire in &ldquo;Bleeding Kansas,&rdquo;
where a bitter 5-year war between pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions left
death and destruction in its wake and foreshadowed a larger conflict to
come. Most were students of guerrilla tactics; all were willing to die to
free the slaves.</p>
<p>This strange little force, five Negroes and 14 whites, was the
&ldquo;Provisional Army of the United States,&rdquo; about to launch a fantastic
scheme to rid the country of its &ldquo;peculiar institution&rdquo; once and for all,
a scheme conjured up by the fierce-eyed, bearded man seated on the
wagon&mdash;&ldquo;Commander in Chief&rdquo; John Brown. He was the planner, the
organizer, the driving force, the reason why these men were trudging down
this rough Maryland road to an uncertain fate.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">THE ROAD TO HARPERS FERRY</span></h2>
<p>This man who would electrify the Nation and bring it closer to civil
war by his audacious attack on slavery was born at Torrington, Conn.,
on May 9, 1800, the son of Owen and Ruth Mills Brown. The Browns
were a simple, frugal, and hard-working family. They had a deep and
abiding interest in religion, and from earliest childhood John Brown was
taught the value of strong religious habits. He was required, along with
his brothers and sisters, to participate in daily Bible reading and prayer
sessions. &ldquo;Fear God &amp; keep his commandments&rdquo; was his father&rsquo;s constant
admonition. It was also his father who taught him to view the enslavement
of Negroes as a sin against God.</p>

<p class="pcap">The future abolitionist and martyr in the cause
of Negro freedom was born in this stark, shutterless
farmhouse in Torrington, Conn. He lived
here only 5 years. In 1805 his father, Owen
Brown (above), sold the farm and moved the
family west to Ohio.</p>
</div>
<p>In 1805 the Browns, like many other families of the period, moved
west to Ohio. There, in the little settlement of Hudson, about 25 miles
south of Cleveland, John grew to manhood. He received little formal
education; most of what he learned came from what he afterwards called
the &ldquo;School of adversity.&rdquo; He cared little for studies, preferring life in
the open. Consistently choosing the &ldquo;hardest &amp; roughest&rdquo; kinds of play
because they afforded him &ldquo;almost the only compensation for the
confinement &amp; restraints of school,&rdquo; he was extremely proud of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
ability to &ldquo;wrestle, &amp; Snow ball, &amp; run, &amp; jump, &amp; knock off old seedy
Wool hats.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">

<p class="pcap">John Brown probably never saw a slave auction, portrayed
here in an illustration from the 1852 edition of Harriet
Beecher Stowe&rsquo;s <span class="noti">Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin</span>, but his horror and
hatred of slavery made its destruction the &ldquo;greatest or
principle object&rdquo; of his life.</p>
</div>
<p>When John was 8 years old his mother died, and for awhile he believed
that he would never recover from so &ldquo;complete &amp; permanent&rdquo; a loss.
His father remarried, but John never accepted his stepmother emotionally
and &ldquo;continued to pine after his own Mother for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An indifferent student, and &ldquo;not ... much of a schollar&rdquo; anyway,
John quit school and went to work at his father&rsquo;s tannery. Owen Brown,
who had been a tanner and a shoemaker before moving to Hudson, had
already taught his son the art of dressing leather from &ldquo;Squirel, Raccoon,
Cat, Wolf, or Dog Skins,&rdquo; and John soon displayed remarkable ability
in the trade. When the War of 1812 broke out, Owen contracted to supply
beef to the American forces in Michigan. He gave John the task of
rounding up wild steers and other cattle in the woods and then driving
them, all by himself, to army posts more than 100 miles away. Contact
with the soldiers and their profanity and lack of discipline so disgusted
young Brown that he later resolved to pay fines rather than take part in
the militia drills required of all Hudson males of a certain age.</p>
<p>It was during the war, or so Brown later claimed, that he first came to
understand what his father meant about the evil of slavery. He had just
completed one of his cattle drives and was staying with a &ldquo;very
gentlemanly landlord&rdquo; who owned a slave about the same age as John.
The Negro boy was &ldquo;badly clothed, poorly fed ... &amp; beaten before his
eyes with Iron Shovels or any other thing that came first to hand.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
Outraged by this, John returned home &ldquo;a most determined Abolitionist&rdquo;
swearing &ldquo;Eternal war with Slavery.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pcap">John Brown had not yet grown his

<p class="pcap">Mary Ann Day, Brown&rsquo;s

second wife, stoically endured
her husband&rsquo;s constant
wanderings in business and
anti-slavery activities. She
is shown here about 1851
with two of their daughters,
Annie and Sarah.</p>
</div>
<p>In 1816 John joined the Congregational Church in Hudson and soon
developed a strong interest in becoming a minister. For a while he attended
a divinity school in Plainfield, Mass., then transferred to another school
in Litchfield, Conn. At that time Litchfield was a center of abolitionist
sentiment; it was also the birthplace of Harriet Beecher Stowe, whose book
<span class="noti">Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin</span>, published in 1852, would stir passions North and
South, win international support for the anti-slavery cause, and help to
bring on civil war in 1861. How much of Litchfield&rsquo;s abolitionist
atmosphere young Brown absorbed is not known. A shortage of funds
and an inflammation of the eyes forced him to return to Ohio in the
summer of 1817. His dream of becoming a minister was forever shattered,
but he never lost his religious fervor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>When he was 20 years old, &ldquo;led by his own inclination &amp; prompted
also by his Father,&rdquo; Brown married Dianthe Lusk, a &ldquo;remarkably plain&rdquo;
and pious girl a year younger than himself. She died 12 years later, in
August 1832, following the birth of their seventh child. Brown remarried
within a year, and fathered 13 children by his second wife, Mary Ann Day.
In a never-ending struggle to feed and clothe his growing family, Brown
drifted through Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, and
Massachusetts plying many trades. He worked at tanning, surveying, and
farming; at times he was shepherd, cattleman, wool merchant, and
postmaster; for a while he bred race horses and speculated in real estate.
Uniformly unsuccessful in these ventures, Brown&rsquo;s debts mounted, and
he was barely able to keep his large family from starvation.</p>
<p>Despite his frequent business reversals and his strenuous and consuming
efforts to support his family, Brown never abandoned his intense desire
to free enslaved Negroes from bondage. His first opportunity to strike a
blow at the institution he hated so much came in Kansas, where, following
the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854, pro-slavery &ldquo;Border
Ruffians&rdquo; clashed brutally with anti-slavery &ldquo;Jayhawkers&rdquo; over the
extension of slavery to Kansas and Nebraska Territories.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">

<p class="pcap">John Brown, Jr., the oldest of
Brown&rsquo;s sons, fought alongside his
father in Kansas. The Pottawatomie
murders, in which he took no part,
caused him to suffer a mental collapse
from which he never fully recovered.
Nevertheless, in 1859 he was entrusted
with forwarding the weapons
for the attack on Harpers Ferry
from Ohio to Chambersburg, Pa.</p>
</div>
<p>Five of Brown&rsquo;s sons&mdash;Owen, Jason, Frederick, Salmon, and John,
Jr.&mdash;had emigrated to Kansas and joined the free-soil cause. When they
appealed to their father for help in May 1855, Brown, another son Oliver,
and son-in-law Henry Thompson rushed to Kansas and plunged into the
conflict with a fury. As captain of the &ldquo;Liberty Guards,&rdquo; a quasi-militia
company that he himself formed, Brown shortly gained national notoriety
as a bold and ruthless leader.</p>
<p>For the next several years, murders, bushwhackings, lynchings, and
burnings were common occurrences, and the territory was aptly named
&ldquo;Bleeding Kansas.&rdquo; Atrocity matched atrocity. When pro-slavery forces
sacked and burned the town of Lawrence in May 1856, Brown was outraged.
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
Proclaiming himself an instrument of God&rsquo;s will, he, with four of his
sons and three others, deliberately and brutally murdered five pro-slavery
men along the banks of Pottawatomie Creek. In the months that followed,
Brown terrorized the Missouri-Kansas border by a series of bloody
guerrilla attacks that brought him to the attention of the Nation&rsquo;s
abolitionist faction. In late August 1856, about a month before he left
Kansas, Brown and his men clashed with pro-slavery Missourians at the
small settlement of Osawatomie. That action earned him the nickname
&ldquo;Osawatomie&rdquo; and cost him the life of his son Frederick. It also hardened
his stand against slavery. &ldquo;I have only a short time to live&mdash;only one
death to die,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I will die fighting for this cause. There will be
no more peace in this land until slavery is done for. I will give them
something else to do than to extend slave territory. I will carry this war
into Africa.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>The attack on Harpers Ferry was the culmination of a plan Brown
had evolved many years before he went to Kansas. By the early 1850&rsquo;s
he had come to believe that a location within the slave States should be
selected where raids on slave plantations could be easily carried out and
the freed bondsmen sent to safety in the North. Convinced that mountains
throughout history had enabled the few to defend themselves against the
many, he believed that even against regular Army troops a small force
operating from a mountain stronghold could hold out indefinitely and
provide sanctuary for freed slaves, who would be supplied with arms to
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
fight for their liberty. Brown had decided, from studying European
fortifications and military operations, that somewhere along the Allegheny
Mountain chain a small force could achieve those objectives.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1857, on his second trip to Kansas, Brown began
recruiting his force for the projected raid. Among the first to join him
were three young veterans of the Kansas fighting: John E. Cook, Aaron D.
Stevens, and John H. Kagi. Each would play an important role in the
attack on Harpers Ferry.</p>
<p>Cook, 27-year-old member of a wealthy Connecticut family, had
attended Yale University and studied law in New York City before going
to Kansas in 1855. He stood about 5 feet 5 inches tall, had long, silk-blond
hair that curled about his neck, and &ldquo;his deep blue eyes were gentle in
expression as a woman&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Brown&rsquo;s son Salmon, who knew Cook in Ohio
and Kansas, characterized him as &ldquo;highly erratic&rdquo; in temperament &ldquo;and
not overly stocked with morality. He was the best pistol-shot I ever
saw ... [and] just as much of an expert in getting into the good graces
of the girls.&rdquo; He loved to &ldquo;talk and rattle on about himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stevens, then 26 years old, was, like Cook, a native of Connecticut.
He ran away from home at the age of 16 and joined the Massachusetts
Volunteer Regiment to fight in the Mexican War. Honorably discharged
at the end of that conflict, he found civilian life so boring that he enlisted
as a bugler in a United States dragoon regiment in the West and took
part in several campaigns against the Navaho and Apache Indians. Stevens
possessed an explosive temper, and at Taos, N. Mex., in the mid-1850&rsquo;s,
he nearly killed an officer in a drunken brawl and was sentenced to death.
President Franklin Pierce commuted the sentence to 3 years&rsquo; hard labor
at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. In January 1856 Stevens escaped and
joined the Free-State cause. As colonel of the Second Kansas Volunteer
Regiment, he fought in some of the territory&rsquo;s bloodiest battles. Standing
just over 6 feet tall, Stevens was a powerfully built man who could wield
a saber with deadly skill. He had black curly hair, &ldquo;black, brooding eyes,&rdquo;
and a full beard. In his youth he had been a choir boy (his father and
elder brothers taught singing), had a rich baritone voice, and liked to sing.
Totally dedicated to the overthrow of slavery, he once told a Kansas
sheriff: &ldquo;We are in the right, and will resist the universe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kagi, an Ohio lad of 22, was largely self-educated and had taught
school in Virginia until his abolitionist views got him into trouble with
local officials and he had to flee the State. Traveling to Kansas in 1856,
he became a lawyer in Nebraska City. Occasionally he served as a court
stenographer or shorthand reporter. He also functioned as a correspondent
for several Eastern newspapers and John Brown dubbed him &ldquo;our Horace
Greeley.&rdquo; While riding with Stevens&rsquo; Second Kansas Regiment in 1856,
Kagi was taken prisoner by Federal troops and served 4 months in jail
before being released on bail. In January 1857 he was shot by a
pro-slavery judge during a disagreement and was still suffering from his
wounds when he joined Brown. Tall, with angular features, Kagi was
usually unkempt, unshaven, and generally unimpressive in appearance;
but he was articulate and highly intelligent, of serene temperament, and
not easily aroused. &ldquo;His fertility of resources made him a tower of
strength to John Brown,&rdquo; wrote George B. Gill, an Iowa youth who signed
up for the raid but defected before it took place. &ldquo;He was a logician of
more than ordinary ability. He was full of wonderful vitality and all
things were fit food for his brain.&rdquo;</p>

Armory and Arsenal at Harpers Ferry,

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>When he enlisted them, Brown told Cook, Stevens, and Kagi only that
he was organizing a company of men to resist pro-slavery aggressions.
He did not tell them where he planned to take them. When seven more
volunteers joined the group at Tabor, Iowa, he informed his recruits that
their &ldquo;ultimate destination was the State of Virginia.&rdquo; Shortly afterwards
the men finally learned that Harpers Ferry was the probable target.
Kagi, who had once taught school in the area, gave Brown valuable
information about the town. The place fitted Brown&rsquo;s requirements
perfectly. It lay near the mountains he counted upon to afford a hiding
place, and it was on the border of Virginia, a slave State, only 40 miles
from the free State of Pennsylvania. It also contained an United States
armory and arsenal, where much-needed arms were stored.</p>
<p>After a trip to New England to raise funds, Brown called a
&ldquo;Constitutional Convention&rdquo; of his followers to meet on May 8, 1858, at
Chatham, Ontario, Canada. Besides Brown&rsquo;s group, 34 Negroes attended
the meeting and heard the Kansas guerrilla chieftain outline his plan for
the deliverance of their enslaved brethren. First, he told them, he intended
to strike at a point in the South. This blow would be followed by a general
slave uprising in which even free Negroes in the Northern States and
Canada would flock to his banner. He would lead them into the mountains
and &ldquo;if any hostile action ... were taken against us, either by the militia
of the separate States or by the armies of the United States, we purposed
to defeat first the militia, and next, if it were possible, the troops of the
United States....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The convention unanimously adopted a &ldquo;Provisional Constitution
and Ordinances for the People of the United States&rdquo; to serve as the law
of the land while the army of liberation instituted a new government&mdash;one
that would not supplant but exist side-by-side with the U.S. Government
and which would explicitly prohibit slavery. John Brown was elected
&ldquo;Commander in Chief&rdquo; of the new provisional army to be formed, other
officers were appointed, and the convention adjourned. Before leaving
again for New England to gather supplies and money for the attack,
Brown sent Cook to Harpers Ferry to act as a spy; the others scattered,
seeking employment to maintain themselves until called together for the
march into Virginia.</p>

<p>To equip, maintain, and transport the men needed to carry out his
plan, Brown required a considerable amount of money and weapons. He
had neither, but because of his Kansas activities, he was able to enlist
the support of Northern abolitionists in his fight against slavery.
Philosophers, scholars, religious leaders, philanthropists, and businessmen
gave freely but discreetly to the cause. Chief among Brown&rsquo;s backers was
a secret committee of six: Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe, Boston, Mass.,
educator, minister, and reformer; Thomas Wentworth Higginson, militant
clergyman of Worcester, Mass.; Theodore Parker, Boston&rsquo;s outstanding
Unitarian minister; Franklin B. Sanborn, editor and schoolmaster of
Concord, Mass.; Gerrit Smith, former New York Congressman and a great
Peterboro, N.Y., landowner; and George L. Stearns, industrialist and
merchant of Medford, Mass. Through them Brown received most of the
money and weapons that enabled him to launch his attack.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">RENDEZVOUS FOR REVOLUTION</span></h2>
<p>By the summer of 1859 Harpers Ferry was a quietly thriving little
industrial and transportation community sitting on a narrow shelf of land
at the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers in the Blue
Ridge Mountains of northern Virginia. Until its selection as the site for
a Federal armory at the end of the 18th century, the town&rsquo;s growth had
been slow. What growth it did experience was due to its location on the
wilderness route to the Shenandoah Valley. The land on which the town
sat was first settled in 1733 by a Pennsylvania Dutchman named Peter
Stephens, who operated a small ferryboat service across the rivers. At that
time the place was called &ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s Hole&rdquo; because it was dominated by
three towering bluffs&mdash;Maryland Heights to the north, Loudoun Heights
to the south, and Bolivar Heights to the west. When Robert Harper, a
skilled Philadelphia architect and millwright, bought the land in 1747,
he improved the ferry service and built a gristmill. Around these facilities
at the base of Bolivar Heights the village of Harpers Ferry gradually
developed.</p>
<p>In 1794, when relations between the United States and England were
strained, Congress grew uneasy over the country&rsquo;s military posture.
Uncertain of the ordnance-producing capabilities of private manufacturers
in time of need, it directed President George Washington to establish a
number of armories where guns could be made and stored. One of the
sites he chose was Harpers Ferry.</p>
<p>Washington was well acquainted with Harpers Ferry. As a young man
during the middle part of the century, he had accompanied surveying
parties that inspected the vast holdings of the Virginia aristocracy in this
area. He considered Harpers Ferry &ldquo;the most eligible spot on the
[Potomac] river&rdquo; for an armory. Abundant water power was available,
iron ore was plentiful nearby, hardwood forests insured a steady supply
of charcoal to fuel the forges, and the place was far enough inland to be
secure from foreign invasion.</p>
<p>In June 1796 the Government purchased from the Harper heirs a 125-acre
tract of land and began constructing workshops on the benchland
between the Potomac River and what would later become Potomac Street.
Waterpower was harnessed by building a dam upstream from the armory
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
and channeling the water through a canal into the workshops. Although
a critical shortage of gunsmiths and ordnance-making machinery restricted
operations for several years, limited arms production began late in 1798
under the direction of an English Moravian named Joseph Perkin, the
armory&rsquo;s first superintendent.</p>
<p>The first muskets, based on the old French infantry type of 1763,
were completed in 1801. In 1803 production was expanded to include rifles,
and 2 years later the manufacture of pistols. (The Model 1805 pistol,
made at Harpers Ferry, was the first hand weapon to be produced at a
United States armory.) At first the rate of musket production was meager,
but by 1810 the armory was turning out 10,000 annually, storing them in
two arsenal buildings nearby on Shenandoah Street.</p>
<p>In 1819 John Hall, a Maine gunsmith, received a contract from the
Federal Government to manufacture 1,000 breech-loading flintlock rifles
of his own design. Sent to Harpers Ferry, he set up the Hall Rifle Works
in two buildings on Lower Hall Island, which adjoined Virginius
Island in the Shenandoah River about &frac12; mile from its junction with the
Potomac. Hall&rsquo;s rifles were made on so exact a scale that all the parts
were interchangeable&mdash;a factor that helped to pave the way for modern
mass production methods. The War Department was elated with Hall&rsquo;s
success and his contract was repeatedly renewed. When the Hall rifle was
discontinued in 1844, the Government tore down the old buildings and
erected a new rifle factory on the same site. Standard U.S. Model rifles
were produced there until the industry was destroyed, along with the
armory complex, at the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861.</p>
<p>The abundance of water power that had attracted the arms industry
soon brought others. Besides the rifle factories on Hall Island, Virginius
Island boasted an iron foundry, flour mill, cotton mill, and machine shop,
all powered by water diverted through the island by a dam in the
Shenandoah River and a series of sluiceways and underground water
tunnels. More than 200 persons made their home around the prospering
island industries.</p>
<p>The formation, development, and expansion of the United States
Armory and Arsenal at Harpers Ferry (its complete, official designation)
was the chief stimulus for the growth of the town. From a simple
beginning the armory by 1859 had spread to include 20 workshops and
offices, lined in a neat double row over an area 600 yards long. At its
peak, the armory provided employment for more than 400 men, mostly
transplanted Northerners whom local residents classified as &ldquo;foreigners.&rdquo;
In the 65-year history of this major industry, the U.S. Government
invested nearly $2 million in land, water power improvements, walls and
embankments, hydraulic machinery, and buildings.</p>

<p class="pcap">HARPERS FERRY AND VICINITY
1859</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>After 1830 Harpers Ferry, already recognized as an important
industrial center, attained prominence as a vital link in the transportation
and communications line between the Ohio and Shenandoah Valleys and
the East. By 1830 a semi-weekly stagecoach service connected the town
with Washington, D.C. The one-way trip usually required a full day&rsquo;s
travel. That same year a turnpike company was founded to construct a
16-mile macadamized toll road from Harpers Ferry to Middleway, 5 miles
west of Charles Town. A turnpike being built from Frederick, Md., about
20 miles to the east, reached the town in 1832. Still another turnpike
company, organized in 1851, ran a road from Harpers Ferry southeastward
to Hillsborough, about 10 miles away.</p>
<p>But the signal impetus to the establishment of the town&rsquo;s commercial
position was the arrival of canal and railroad. Waging a bitter battle to
reach the rich Ohio Valley and carry its trade to the East, impeding each
other&rsquo;s progress at every opportunity, the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal
(originating in Washington, D.C.) and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
(originating in Baltimore, Md.) reached Harpers Ferry in the early 1830&rsquo;s.
Following the winding Potomac River northward and westward from
Georgetown, the C &amp; O Canal arrived at Harpers Ferry in November 1833,
more than a year ahead of its rival. But the railroad pushed on to
the Ohio Valley while the canal stopped at Cumberland, Md. The
establishment of these two arteries provided shippers with a cheaper
carrier for their products and assured travelers of a more efficient and
economical means of reaching their destinations.</p>
<p>With the expansion of industry and the development of superior
transportation facilities, the population of the community swelled to nearly
3,000 by 1859. Of these about 150 were &ldquo;free coloreds&rdquo; and 150 were
slaves. The total number of slaves in the entire six-county area around
Harpers Ferry was just slightly more than 18,000, of which less than
5,000 were men. There were no large plantations because the land and the
climate could not sustain a plantation economy. The few slaveholders
maintained farms, and their blacks were mainly &ldquo;well-kept house-servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most of the white residents of Harpers Ferry worked at the armory or
at the manufacturing plants on Virginius Island. Because land was at a
premium, the houses, saloons, hotels, and shops were tightly aligned along
Shenandoah, Potomac, and High Streets, and sprawled up the slopes of
Bolivar Heights. In some places the rocky cliffs were blasted away to
make room for another building. Most of the homes were of simple design,
but the Government-built residences of the armory officials were more
elaborate.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the town were chiefly of Irish, English, and German
descent. Besides building six churches of varying faiths (one of which,
St. Peter&rsquo;s Catholic Church, is still standing and in use today), they
established five private girls&rsquo; schools. A man could get a drink at the Gault
House or take a meal at the Potomac Restaurant or the Wager House.
If he so desired, he could join the Masons, the Odd Fellows, or the Sons of
Temperance. Nearly everyone was prosperous. It was a good time for the
town and its people.</p>

<p>John Brown arrived amidst this prosperity on July 3, 1859. Not yet
60 years old, the rigors of frontier living had nevertheless left their imprint
upon him and there were those who said he looked and walked more than
ever &ldquo;like an old man.&rdquo; In March a Cleveland, Ohio, newspaper had
described him as &ldquo;a medium-sized, compactly-built and wiry man, and
as quick as a cat in his movements. His hair is of a salt and pepper hue
and as stiff as bristles, he has a long, waving, milk-white goatee, which
gives him a somewhat patriarchal appearance, his eyes are gray and sharp.&rdquo;
He had grown the beard before his last trip to Kansas in 1858, and it
covered his square chin and straight, firm mouth, changing his appearance
markedly. When he arrived in Harpers Ferry the beard had been shortened
to within an inch and a half of his face, because, his daughter Annie later
recalled, he thought it &ldquo;more likely to disguise him than a clean face or
than the long beard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Brown were two of his sons&mdash;34-year-old Owen and 20-year-old
Oliver&mdash;and Kansas veteran Jeremiah G. Anderson. The 26-year-old,
Indiana-born Anderson was the grandson of Southern slaveholders and
had joined the abolitionist cause in 1857 after working several unproductive
years as a peddler, farmer, and sawyer. Determined to eliminate slavery,
Anderson once vowed to &ldquo;make this land of liberty and equality shake to
the centre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After consulting briefly with Cook, who had been serving as a
schoolteacher, book salesman, and canal-lock tender, and had even married
a local girl since being sent to Harpers Ferry the year before, Brown and
his three companions took up residence in a private home in Sandy Hook,
a small village about a mile down the Potomac on the Maryland shore.
The names they gave their landlord were &ldquo;Isaac Smith &amp; Sons.&rdquo; To
anyone asking their business in the area, Brown told them they were
simple farmers looking for good farmland to develop.</p>
<p>Brown arose early on July 4 and began exploring the Maryland side
of the Potomac to find a suitable hideout for his raiders. Local inquiry
led him to a farm owned by the heirs of a Dr. R. F. Kennedy about 5
miles north of Harpers Ferry. A cursory inspection convinced him that
the place, though small, was conveniently located and admirably suited
for concealment. The farm was remote from other settlements, and it was
surrounded by woods and hidden by undergrowth&mdash;an ideal situation
for hiding men and supplies from the gaze of inquisitive neighbors.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>For $35 in gold Brown rented the farm, which consisted of two log
structures, some outbuildings, and a pasture. The main house sat about
100 yards off the public road connecting Harpers Ferry with
Boonesborough and Sharpsburg, Md., and contained a basement kitchen
and storerooms, a second-floor living room and bedrooms, and an attic.
The second floor was used as kitchen, parlor, and dining room, and the
attic served as a storeroom, drilling room, and &ldquo;prison&rdquo; to keep the men
out of sight. Near the farmhouse stood a small cabin that later became a
storage place and sleeping quarters for some of the raiders.</p>

<p class="pcap">To help avert suspicion, Brown&rsquo;s
daughter Annie and Oliver&rsquo;s wife Martha
(shown here with her husband in 1859)
lived at the farm while the arms and
men were being assembled. Martha did
the cooking and helped Annie with
household chores.</p>
</div>
<p>Brown&rsquo;s chief fear was that neighbors would become suspicious of
&ldquo;Isaac Smith &amp; Sons&rdquo; and possibly uncover his revolutionary plans.
Reasoning that nearby families would be less distrustful with women
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
among the group, he appealed to his wife and daughter Annie at their
home in North Elba, N.Y., to come live with him, saying that &ldquo;It will be
likely to prove the most valuable service you can ever render to the world.&rdquo;
Mrs. Brown was unable to make the long journey, but Annie and Oliver&rsquo;s
wife Martha did join him in mid-July. Their presence proved of
inestimable value not only in alleviating suspicion but in contributing to
the morale of the men. Martha served as cook and housekeeper, preparing
meals on a wood stove in the upstairs living room; Annie kept constant
watch for prying neighbors. &ldquo;When I washed dishes,&rdquo; noted Annie many
years later,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I stood at the end of the table where I could see out of the window
and open door if any one approached the house. I was constantly on
the lookout while carrying the victuals across the porch, and while
I was tidying or sweeping the rooms, and always at my post on the
porch when the men were eating. My evenings were spent on the porch
or sitting on the stairs, watching or listening.</p>

<p>His base established, Brown laid plans to assemble his arms and
supplies and to gather in his followers. On July 10 he wrote to John Kagi
at Chambersburg, Pa., where an arms depot had been set up, giving him
directions for forwarding the waiting men and the &ldquo;freight&rdquo;&mdash;200 Sharps
rifles, an equal number of pistols, and a thousand pikes. The weapons,
crated in large wooden boxes marked &ldquo;Hardware and Castings,&rdquo; were
shipped from Ohio to Chambersburg where Kagi sent them by wagon to
Brown at the Kennedy farm. Supplies were acquired at various places
between Chambersburg and Harpers Ferry.</p>
<p>Alone and in twos and threes, Brown&rsquo;s followers began to assemble at
the farm. Watson Brown arrived on August 6. &ldquo;Tall and rather fair, with
finely knit frame, athletic and active,&rdquo; the 24-year-old Watson brought
with him two of his brothers-in-law and North Elba neighbors, William
and Dauphin Thompson. The Thompsons had not previously taken active
roles in the anti-slavery movement but they were dedicated abolitionists.
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
William, 26 years old, was fun-loving and good natured. He had started
for Kansas in 1856 but turned back before reaching there. His 20-year-old
brother Dauphin had never been away from home before. Handsome,
inexperienced, with curly, golden hair and a soft complexion, he seemed
&ldquo;more like a girl than a warrior&rdquo; and was &ldquo;diffident and quiet.&rdquo; Both
had come to the Kennedy farm because they were firmly convinced of
the justness of John Brown&rsquo;s cause.</p>
<p>Next came Aaron Stevens and Charles Plummet Tidd, a 25-year-old
former Maine woodsman. Tidd was a Kansas veteran. He had been one
of the first to join Brown at Tabor, Iowa, in 1857 and had remained one
of his closest associates ever since. He was quick-tempered, but according
to Annie Brown, &ldquo;His rages soon passed and then he tried all he could to
repair damages. He was a fine singer and of strong family affections.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>Tidd and Stevens were followed by 22-year-old Albert Hazlett, another
veteran of the Kansas fighting, Canadian-born Stewart Taylor, and two
brothers from Iowa, Edwin and Barclay Coppoc. Hazlett had worked on
his brother&rsquo;s farm in western Pennsylvania before joining Brown at the
Kennedy farm. He was totally committed to the overthrow of slavery.
&ldquo;I am willing to die in the cause of liberty,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;if I had ten thousand
lives I would willingly lay them all down for the same cause.&rdquo; Taylor,
23 years old, was once a wagonmaker. He had met Brown in Iowa in 1858
and was &ldquo;heart and soul in the anti-slavery cause.&rdquo; Scholarly, a good
debater, and &ldquo;very fond of studying history,&rdquo; Taylor, like Stevens, was a
spiritualist and had a premonition that he would die at Harpers Ferry.
The Coppocs were Quakers by birth and training. They were in Kansas
during the troubles there but took no part in the fighting. Edwin, at 24,
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
was 4 years older than his brother Barclay. Both had joined Brown
initially in 1858 at Springdale, Iowa, where they were living with their
mother, shortly before the Chatham Convention.</p>
<p>Twenty-year-old William H. Leeman arrived near the end of August.
Born and educated in Maine, he had worked in a Haverhill, Mass., shoe
factory before going to Kansas in 1856 where he served in Brown&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Liberty Guards&rdquo; militia company. Impulsive, hard to control, the 6-foot-tall
Leeman &ldquo;smoked a good deal and drank sometimes,&rdquo; but he had &ldquo;a
good intellect with great ingenuity.&rdquo; Shortly before the raid he wrote his
mother that he was &ldquo;warring with slavery, the greatest curse that ever
infected America. We are determined to strike for freedom, incite the slaves
to rebellion, and establish a free government. With the help of God we
will carry it through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Leeman came Dangerfield Newby, a mulatto born a slave but
freed by his Scotch father, and Osborn P. Anderson, a 33-year-old free
Negro who had worked as a printer before joining Brown in Canada in
1858. Newby, at 44 the oldest of the group save for Brown himself, had
a wife and several children in bondage in the South. He came to the
Kennedy farmhouse convinced that the only way to free them was with
rifle and bullet. Week after week he would read and reread a worn letter
from his wife in which she begged him to &ldquo;Buy me and the baby, that
has just commenced to crawl, as soon as possible, for if you do not get me
somebody else will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emperor&rdquo; Shields Green, a 23-year-old illiterate escaped slave from
Charleston, S.C., joined up at Chambersburg where Brown had gone in
mid-August to enlist the aid of the famed Negro abolitionist, orator, and
journalist, Frederick Douglass. Brown and Douglass had first met at
Springfield, Mass., in 1847. Since then they had become good friends.
When the Negro leader learned the details of the planned assault on
Harpers Ferry, he refused to participate, arguing that an attack on the
Government would &ldquo;array the whole country&rdquo; against him and antagonize
the very people to whom the abolitionists looked for support. Moreover,
Douglass believed that the plan could not succeed, that Brown &ldquo;was going
into a perfect steel-trap, and that once in he would never get out alive.&rdquo;
Before leaving, Douglass asked Shields Green, who had accompanied him
to the meeting, what he intended to do. Green replied simply, &ldquo;I b&rsquo;lieve
I&rsquo;ll go wid de ole man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Life at the Kennedy farm was wearing and tedious. Brown&rsquo;s most
trying task was to keep his slowly increasing force occupied and out of
sight. Forced to remain in the two small buildings during the day, the
men had little to do. The long summer days were mostly spent reading
magazines, telling stories, arguing politics and religion, and playing
checkers and cards. They drilled frequently and studied the art of guerrilla
warfare from a specially prepared military manual.</p>
<p>Meals were served downstairs in the farmhouse, with Annie and
Martha standing guard while the men ate. After breakfast each morning,
John Brown would read from the Bible and utter a short prayer.
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
Occasionally he would travel into Harpers Ferry to pick up a Baltimore
newspaper to which he subscribed or to purchase flour from the mill on
Virginius Island. If a neighbor arrived unexpectedly during mealtime,
the men would gather up the food, dishes, and table cloth and carry them
to the attic.</p>

</div>
<p>At night the men could go outdoors for fresh air and exercise.
Thunderstorms were especially welcomed, for then they could move about
with little fear of making noise. These brief interludes served to release
tensions built up during long periods of confinement and inactivity, but
the secret living in such close quarters proved almost too much to bear.
Restiveness and irritations were bound to occur. Twice there was a near
revolt against the planned raid. On one occasion Tidd became so infuriated
that he left the farm and stayed with Cook in Harpers Ferry for 3 days.
So serious was the opposition that Brown tendered his resignation as
commander in chief. He withdrew it only after the men gave him a renewed
vote of confidence.</p>
<p>As September ended and the time for the attack approached, Annie
and Martha were sent back to North Elba. Brown and his men busied
themselves overhauling the rifles and pistols and attaching pike-heads to
shafts. The pikes were Brown&rsquo;s own idea. Preparing for a return to Kansas
in 1857, he had negotiated with a Connecticut blacksmith to manufacture
1,000 of these weapons&mdash;a two-edged dirk with an iron blade 8 inches
long fastened to a 6-foot ash handle. Originally they were intended for
the defense of free-soil settlers in Kansas, but Brown was unable to pay
for them until the spring of 1859, when he made final arrangements to use
them at Harpers Ferry. Knowing that most of the slaves he expected to
join him were unskilled in the use of firearms, he decided they could
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
handle a pike. A thousand men armed with pikes and backed by Brown&rsquo;s
more experienced &ldquo;soldiers&rdquo; could constitute a formidable army.</p>
<p>Because so many people knew about Brown&rsquo;s intentions, it was
inevitable that the secrecy would be broken. In late August Secretary of
War John B. Floyd received an unsigned letter reporting &ldquo;the existence
of a secret association, having for its object the liberation of the slaves at
the South by a general insurrection.&rdquo; Brown was named as its leader and
&ldquo;an armory in Maryland&rdquo; its immediate objective. Because the informant
mistakenly placed the armory in Maryland instead of Virginia and
because Floyd could not bring himself to believe such a scheme could be
entertained by citizens of the United States, the Secretary put the letter
away and forgot about it until subsequent events reminded him of the
warning.</p>
<p>October arrived. Still Brown delayed, hoping that more men would
come. Many upon whom he had counted failed to join him for a variety
of reasons. Even two of his sons, Jason and Salmon, refused to participate.
Though disappointed, Brown realized that the longer he delayed, the
greater were the chances that his plan would be discovered and thwarted.
Finally, on October 15, with the arrival of 22-year-old Francis J. Meriam
and two Ohio Negroes, John Copeland and Lewis S. Leary, both 25, the
ranks of the &ldquo;Provisional Army of the United States&rdquo; were completed.
In all there were 21 men besides the commander in chief. Of these, 19
were under 30, three not yet 21. Brown could wait no longer. Calling his
men together, he announced that the attack would take place the next
night, October 16, and cautioned them about the needless taking of human
life:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You all know how dear life is to you ... consider that the lives of
others are as dear to them as yours are to you; do not, therefore, take
the life of anyone if you can possibly avoid it, but if it is necessary
to take life in order to save your own, then make short work of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">TO FREE THE SLAVES</span></h2>
<p>The daylight hours of Sunday, October 16, 1859, were quiet ones at
the Kennedy farm as the long period of inactivity and uncertainty neared
its climax. Early in the morning John Brown held worship services, the
impending attack invoking &ldquo;deep solemnity&rdquo; upon the gathering. After
breakfast and roll call a final meeting was held and instructions were
given. Then everything was in readiness.</p>
<p>About 8 p.m. Brown turned to his followers. &ldquo;Men,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;get on
your arms; we will proceed to the Ferry.&rdquo; The men, ready for hours, slung
their Sharps rifles over their shoulders, concealing them under long, gray
shawls that served as overcoats, and waited for the order to march. A
horse and wagon were brought to the door of the farmhouse. In the wagon
the men placed a few items that might be needed for the work ahead:
a sledge hammer, a crowbar, and several pikes. Owen Brown, Barclay
Coppoc, and Meriam were detailed to remain at the farm as a rearguard.
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
In the morning they were to bring the rest of the weapons nearer the
town where they could be passed out to the slave army Brown expected
to raise.</p>
<p>Donning his battered old Kansas cap, symbol of the violence to which
he had contributed in that strife-torn territory, Brown mounted the wagon
and motioned his men to move out. From the farmhouse the group moved
down the lane and onto the road leading to Harpers Ferry. Tidd and
Cook, who were best acquainted with the route, preceded the main body
as scouts. Upon reaching the town they were to cut the telegraph lines on
both the Maryland and Virginia sides of the Potomac.</p>

Ferry as an arsenal after the raid began.

David Hunter Strother, known to
readers of <span class="noti">Harper&rsquo;s New Monthly Magazine</span>
as &ldquo;Porte Crayon,&rdquo; one of the most popular
illustrators of mid-19th century America.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>For more than 2 hours the men tramped along behind the wagon,
strictly adhering to Brown&rsquo;s order to maintain silence. About 10:30 p.m.
they reached the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad bridge that would carry
them into Harpers Ferry. It was a long wooden-covered structure that
spanned the Potomac River a little upstream from where the Shenandoah
comes spilling in from the south. Kagi and Stevens entered first and
encountered watchman William Williams, who approached with a lantern.
They quickly took Williams prisoner. The rest of the raiders, except for
Watson Brown and Stewart Taylor who were told to stay on the Maryland
side as a rearguard, fastened cartridges boxes to the outside of their
clothing for ready access and followed the wagon onto the bridge.</p>
<p>Crossing quickly, the raiders stepped from the tunnel&rsquo;s black throat
into the slumbering town. Before them lay a large structure that doubled
as the railroad depot and the Wager House. Just beyond, to the left, was
the U.S. Arsenal buildings where thousands of guns were stored. To the
right the armory shops stretched in a double row along the Potomac.
Brown turned the horse and wagon toward the armory.</p>
<p>Daniel Whelan, the armory&rsquo;s nightwatchman, heard the wagon coming
down the street from the depot. Thinking it was the head watchman, he
came out from his station in the fire enginehouse (a one-story, two-room
brick building that doubled as a guard post just inside the armory
grounds) to find several rifles pointed at him. &ldquo;Open the gate!&rdquo; someone
yelled. Out of sheer cussedness, or perhaps fright, Whelan refused. One
of the raiders took the crowbar from the wagon and twisted it in the chain
until the lock snapped. The gate was thrown open and the wagon rolled
into the yard. To his prisoners, Whelan and Williams, Brown announced
his purpose:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I came here from Kansas, and this is a slave state; I want to free
all the Negroes in this state; I have possession now of the United
States armory, and if the citizens interfere with me I must only burn
the town and have blood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once in control of the armory, Brown detailed his men to other
objectives. Oliver Brown and William Thompson were sent to watch the
bridge across the Shenandoah River, while Hazlett and Edwin Coppoc
moved into the unguarded arsenal. Another group of raiders under Stevens
made its way down Shenandoah Street to the rifle factory on Lower Hall
Island. Again the watchman was surprised and easily captured. Telling
Kagi and Copeland to watch the rifle works&mdash;Leary would join them
later&mdash;Stevens marched the watchman and several young men picked up
on the street back to the armory grounds.</p>
<p>So far Brown&rsquo;s occupation of the town had been quiet and peaceful.
It did not last. About midnight another watchman, Patrick Higgins, a
Sandy Hook resident, arrived at the Maryland end of the B &amp; O bridge
to relieve Williams. Finding the structure dark he called out loudly; he
was answered quietly by Taylor and Watson Brown, who took him
prisoner. As he was being escorted across the bridge, Higgins suddenly
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
lashed out, struck Brown in the face, and raced toward the town. Taylor
fired after him. The ball grazed the watchman&rsquo;s scalp, but he reached
the Wager House safely. The first shot of the raid had been fired.</p>
<p>About this same time Stevens led several raiders on a special mission to
capture Col. Lewis W. Washington, the 46-year-old great-grandnephew
of George Washington. The colonel, a small but prosperous planter, lived
near Halltown just off the Charles Town Turnpike about 5 miles west of
Harpers Ferry. He owned a pistol presented to General Washington by
the Marquis de Lafayette and a sword reportedly presented by the
Prussian King Frederick the Great. Brown wanted these weapons. When
he struck the first blow to free the slaves he rather fancied the idea of
wearing the sword and brandishing the pistol once owned by the man who
had led the fight to free the American colonists from a similar kind of
tyranny.</p>
<p>Battering down Washington&rsquo;s door, Stevens, Tidd, Cook, and three
Negroes&mdash;Anderson, Leary, and Green&mdash;summoned the colonel from his
bed. Washington offered no resistance. Calmly surrendering the sword and
pistol, he then dressed and climbed into his carriage for the trip to Harpers
Ferry. The raiders and Washington&rsquo;s three slaves crammed into the
colonel&rsquo;s four-horse farm wagon and followed along behind the carriage.</p>

<p>On the way the procession stopped at the home of another slaveholder,
John Allstadt, just west of Bolivar Heights. Again using a fence rail to
gain entrance, the raiders forced Allstadt and his 18-year-old son into the
wagon while the terror-stricken women of the house shrieked &ldquo;Murder!&rdquo;
from the upstairs windows. Allstadt&rsquo;s four slaves were also added to the
group.</p>
<p>While Stevens&rsquo; party was gathering hostages, the first note of
tragedy was sounded. At 1:25 a.m. the Baltimore and Ohio passenger train
eastbound for Baltimore arrived at Harpers Ferry and was stopped by a
clerk from the Wager House who told conductor A. J. Phelps of the recent
&ldquo;startling&rdquo; events. Phelps refused to allow the train to cross the bridge
until it had been checked, and he sent engineer William McKay and
baggagemaster Jacob Cromwell out to investigate. They were halted by
Brown&rsquo;s guards, who turned them back at gunpoint.</p>
<p>Hayward Shepherd, the station baggageman, heard the commotion and
walked out to see what was going on. Shepherd, a free Negro, was highly
respected and well-liked by all who knew him. As he approached the
bridge a raider told him to halt. Instead, Shepherd turned around and
started back toward the station. A shot rang out and he fell gravely
wounded. He dragged himself back to the station where he died the next
afternoon. The first person to die at the hands of the men who had come to
free the slaves was, in fact, a Negro already free.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig37">

Brown&rsquo;s men on October 17, is the only known
portrait of this tragic figure.</p>
</div>
<p>Between 4 and 5 a.m. the caravan containing Colonel Washington and
the Allstadts arrived at the armory. Brown armed the frightened slaves
with pikes and told them to guard the prisoners, who were placed in the
enginehouse and now numbered about a half-dozen. &ldquo;Keep these white
men inside,&rdquo; he said. Turning to Washington, Brown explained that he had
taken him hostage because &ldquo;as the aid to the Governor of Virginia, I knew
you would endeavor to perform your duty, and perhaps you would have
been a troublesome customer to me; and, apart from that, I wanted you
particularly for the moral effect it would give our cause, having one of your
name our prisoner.&rdquo; As dawn approached the number of Brown&rsquo;s prisoners
increased as unsuspecting armory employees reporting for work were
seized as they passed through the gate. Perhaps as many as 40 hostages
were eventually jammed into the two rooms of the enginehouse.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>Near dawn, John Cook, with two raiders and a handful of pike-carrying
Negroes, took the wagon across the bridge into Maryland to bring the
weapons closer to the town to arm the hundreds of slaves soon expected
to join the fight. The rest of Brown&rsquo;s &ldquo;army&rdquo; settled down at their posts
in the waning darkness to await the coming of day, the last for many
of them.</p>
<p>Thus far the citizens of Harpers Ferry had offered no resistance to the
invasion of their town, primarily because most of the townspeople knew
nothing of what was taking place. At the first streak of daylight, Dr. John
Starry, a 35-year-old local physician who had maintained an all-night
vigil beside the dying Hayward Shepherd, began to alert the people to the
danger. After arousing the residents of Virginius Island, he rode to warn
Acting Armory Superintendent A. M. Kitzmiller. Next he ordered the
Lutheran Church bell rung to assemble the citizens and ascertain what
arms were available for defense. Then he sent a messenger off to
Shepherdstown and another to Charles Town to alert their militia
companies of the armed occupation of Harpers Ferry.</p>
<p>Among the townspeople there were only one or two squirrel rifles and
a few shotguns, none of which were really fit for use. All other weapons
were in the arsenal buildings, and they were occupied by the raiders.
Knowing it would be futile to confront Brown&rsquo;s men unarmed, Dr.
Starry headed for Charles Town, 8 miles away, to hurry its militia along.
But no prompting was necessary. To Charles Town residents the news
from Harpers Ferry was frightening, for it awakened memories of the 1831
Nat Turner slave rebellion in Virginia&rsquo;s tidewater region when more than
50 whites, mostly women and children, were murdered before the bloody
uprising was put down. The Jefferson Guards and another hastily formed
company would march as soon as possible.</p>
<p>At daylight on October 17 Brown allowed the B &amp; O passenger train
to continue its journey to Baltimore. Conductor Phelps wasted no time in
sounding the alarm. At Monocacy, Md., at 7:05 a.m. he telegraphed his
superiors about the night&rsquo;s events, adding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They say they have come to free the slaves and intend to do it
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
at all hazards. The leader of those men requested me to say to
you that this is the last train that shall pass the bridge either East
or West. If it is attempted it will be at the peril of the lives of
those having them in charge.... It has been suggested you had
better notify the Secretary of War at once. The telegraph lines are
cut East and West of Harper&rsquo;s Ferry and this is the first station
that I could send a dispatch from.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John W. Garrett, president of the railroad, saw the message when it came
in and immediately sent word to President James Buchanan and Virginia
Governor Henry A. Wise. At the same time he alerted Maj. Gen. George
H. Stewart, commanding Baltimore&rsquo;s First Light Division of the Maryland
Volunteers. Word was also flashed to Frederick, Md., and that town&rsquo;s
militia was soon under arms.</p>
<p>By 7 a.m. the residents of Harpers Ferry had discovered a supply of
guns in a building overlooked by the raiders, and some of the townspeople
began to move against Brown and his men. Alexander Kelly, armed with
a shotgun, approached the corner of High and Shenandoah Streets, about
100 yards from the armory. Before he could fire, several bullets whizzed
past his head, one putting a hole through his hat. Shortly afterwards,
groceryman Thomas Boerly, a man of great physical strength and
courage, approached the same corner and opened fire on a group of
Brown&rsquo;s men standing in the arsenal yard, diagonally across the street
from the armory gate. A return bullet knocked him down with a &ldquo;ghastly&rdquo;
wound, from which he soon died.</p>
<p>A lull followed the shooting of Boerly. Brown, having made no
provision to feed his men and hostages, released Walter Kemp, an infirm
Wager House bartender captured earlier, in exchange for 45 breakfasts.
But when the food came, few ate it. Many, including Washington, Allstadt,
and Brown himself, feared it had been drugged or poisoned.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kagi, still at the rifle factory, was anxiously sending
messages to Brown urging him to leave Harpers Ferry while they still had
the chance. Brown ignored the pleas and continued to direct operations
with no apparent thought that outside forces would be moving against him
once the alarm had spread. Why, is anybody&rsquo;s guess. Up until noon of
October 17, despite the erratic fire from the townspeople, the raiders could
have fought their way to safety in the mountains. Instead, Brown waited,
doing nothing. By mid-day it was too late, and the jaws of the &ldquo;steel-trap&rdquo;
foreseen by Frederick Douglass closed swiftly.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">THE TIGER CAGED</span></h2>
<p>The Charles Town militia, consisting of the regular company of the
Jefferson Guards and a specially formed volunteer company, was armed
and on its way by train to Harpers Ferry by 10 a.m. The militia
commander, Col. John T. Gibson, had not waited for orders from
Richmond but had set out as soon as the men could be gotten ready.
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
Arriving at Halltown, about midway between Charles Town and Harpers
Ferry, Gibson, fearing the track ahead might be torn up, took the militia
off the train and marched by road to Allstadt&rsquo;s Crossroads west of
Bolivar Heights.</p>

<p class="pcap">William Thompson</p>
</div>
<p>At Allstadt&rsquo;s, Gibson divided his force. He sent Mexican War veteran
Capt. J. W. Rowan with the Jefferson Guards in a wide sweep to the west
of Harpers Ferry to capture the B &amp; O bridge. Gibson himself would take
the volunteer company on into town. Rowan&rsquo;s men crossed the Potomac
about a mile above Harpers Ferry and, advancing along the towpath of the
Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, arrived at the Maryland end of the bridge
by noon. With little difficulty they drove its defenders&mdash;Oliver Brown,
William Thompson, and Dangerfield Newby&mdash;back toward the armory
yard. Only Brown and Thompson made it. Newby, the ex-slave who had
joined John Brown to free his wife and children, was killed by a 6-inch
spike fired from a smoothbore musket. He was the first of the raiders to die.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Colonel Gibson&rsquo;s force had arrived in Harpers Ferry
and he sent a detachment of citizens under Capt. Lawson Botts, a Charles
Town attorney, to secure the Gault House Saloon at the rear of the arsenal
and commanding the Shenandoah bridge and the entrance to the armory
yard. Another detachment under Capt. John Avis, the Charles Town jailer,
took up positions in houses along Shenandoah Street from which to fire
into the arsenal grounds.</p>
<p>The attack of the Charles Town militia cut off Brown&rsquo;s escape route
and separated him from his men in Maryland and those still holding the
rifle factory. At last, perhaps realizing the hopelessness of his situation,
Brown sought a truce. But when hostage Rezin Cross and raider William
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
Thompson emerged from the enginehouse under a white flag, the
townspeople ignored the flag, seized Thompson, and dragged him off to the
Wager House where he was kept under guard.</p>
<p>Still not convinced, Brown tried again. This time he sent his son
Watson and Aaron Stevens with Acting Armory Superintendent Kitzmiller,
taken hostage earlier in the day. As the trio marched onto the street and
came opposite the Galt House, several shots rang out and both raiders fell.
Stevens, severely wounded, lay bleeding in the street; Watson Brown,
mortally wounded, dragged himself back to the enginehouse. Joseph Brua,
one of the hostages, volunteered to aid the wounded Stevens. As bullets
richocheted off the flagstone walk, Brua walked out, lifted up the wounded
raider, and carried him to the Wager House for medical attention. Then,
incredibly, he strolled back to the enginehouse and again took his place
among Brown&rsquo;s prisoners. Kitzmiller escaped.</p>
<p>About the time Stevens and Watson Brown were shot, raider William
Leeman attempted to escape. Dashing through the upper end of the
armory yard, he plunged into the frigid Potomac, comparatively shallow
at this point, and made for the Maryland shore. Soon spotted, a shower
of bullets hit the water around him and he was forced to take refuge on
an islet in the river. G. A. Schoppert, a Harpers Ferry resident, waded
out to where Leeman lay marooned, pointed a pistol at his head, and
pulled the trigger. For the rest of the day Leeman&rsquo;s body was a target for
the undisciplined militia and townspeople.</p>

shot and killed as he came off the bridge.</p>

<p>When a raider shot and killed George W. Turner about 2 p.m., the
crowd grew ugly. Turner, a West Point graduate, was a prominent and
highly respected area planter. When Fontaine Beckham, the mayor of
Harpers Ferry and agent for the B &amp; O Railroad, was killed, the
townspeople turned into a howling, raging mob.</p>
<p>Beckham, a well-liked man of somewhat high-strung temperament, had
been greatly disturbed by the earlier shooting of Hayward Shepherd, his
friend and faithful helper at the depot. Despite warnings from friends to
keep away, Beckham, unarmed, walked out on the railroad to see what
was going on. He paced up and down the B &amp; O trestle bordering the
armory yard about 30 yards from the enginehouse. Several raiders spotted
him peering around the water tower in front of their stronghold and
thought that he was placing himself in position to fire through the doors.
Edwin Coppoc, posted at the doorway of the enginehouse, leveled his
rifle at the mayor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fire, man, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; screamed one of the hostages.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll shoot in here and kill us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coppoc ignored the warning and pulled the trigger. Beckham fell, a
bullet through his heart. Oliver Brown, standing beside Coppoc in the
partly opened doorway, aimed his rifle at another man on the trestle, but
before he could fire he keeled over with &ldquo;a mortal wound that gave horrible
pain.&rdquo; Both of Brown&rsquo;s sons now lay dying at their father&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>Enraged by the shooting of Beckham, the townspeople turned on
prisoner William Thompson. Led by Harry Hunter, a young Charles Town
volunteer and the grandnephew of the murdered mayor, a group of men
stormed into the Wager House, grabbed Thompson, and dragged him out
onto the B &amp; O bridge. &ldquo;You may kill me but it will be revenged,&rdquo;
Thompson yelled; &ldquo;there are eighty thousand persons sworn to carry out
this work.&rdquo; These were his last words. The mob shot him several times and
tossed his body into the Potomac to serve, like Leeman&rsquo;s, as a target for
the remainder of the day.</p>
<p>While Brown&rsquo;s situation at the fire enginehouse was growing
progressively worse, his three-man detachment holding the rifle works came
under fire. Under Kagi&rsquo;s leadership these men had held the works
uncontested during the morning and early afternoon. About 2:30 p.m.
Dr. Starry organized a party of &ldquo;citizens and neighbors&rdquo; and launched
an attack against the raiders from Shenandoah Street. After a brief
exchange of shots, Kagi, Lewis Leary, and John Copeland dashed out the
back of the building, scrambled across the Winchester and Potomac
Railroad tracks, and waded into the shallow Shenandoah River. Some
townspeople posted on the opposite bank spotted the fleeing men and
opened fire. The raiders, caught in a crossfire, made for a large flat rock
in the middle of the river. Kagi, Brown&rsquo;s most trusted and able
lieutenant, was killed in the attempt and Leary was mortally wounded.
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
Copeland reached the rock only to be dragged ashore, where the excited
crowd screamed &ldquo;Lynch him! Lynch him!&rdquo; But Dr. Starry intervened,
and the frightened Negro was hustled off to jail.</p>
<p>At the enginehouse, the raiders continued to exchange occasional shots
with the Charles Town militia and the townspeople. By now Brown had
separated his prisoners. Eleven of the more important hostages who might
be used for bargaining purposes were moved into the engineroom with his
dwindling band, while the others remained crowded into the tiny guardroom.
The two rooms were separated by a solid brick wall.</p>

<p>About 3 p.m., shortly after the raiders were driven out of the rifle
works, a militia company arrived by train from Martinsburg, Va. Headed
by Capt. E. G. Alburtis and comprised mostly of B &amp; O Railroad
employees, this company marched on the enginehouse from the upper end
of the armory yard and came close to ending the raid. Brown positioned
his men in front of the building to meet the attack. Alburtis&rsquo; contingent,
advancing briskly and maintaining a steady fire, forced the raiders back
inside. Smashing the windows of the guardroom, the militiamen freed the
prisoners but were forced to withdraw after eight of their number were
wounded from the constant fire pouring from the partly opened
enginehouse door. Alburtis later complained that had his men been
supported by the other militia companies present, John Brown&rsquo;s raid
would have been ended.</p>
<p>Other militia units now began to arrive. Between 3 and 4 p.m. the
Hamtramck Guards and the Shepherdstown Troop, both from
Shepherdstown, Va., came in. At dusk three uniformed companies from
Frederick, Md., appeared, followed later in the evening by a Winchester,
Va., company under R. B. Washington, and five companies of the
Maryland Volunteers under General Stewart from Baltimore. None of
them made any attempt to dislodge Brown and his men from the
enginehouse, but all added to the general confusion and hysteria gripping
the town.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>On the other side of the Potomac, Cook, Owen Brown, Barclay Coppoc,
Meriam, Tidd, and several Negroes had been transferring weapons to a
tiny schoolhouse midway between Harpers Ferry and the Kennedy farm.
As the day wore on and the firing from town became heavier, they began
to suspect that something might have gone wrong. At about 4 p.m. Cook
headed for the B &amp; O bridge to see what was happening. To get a better
vantage point, he climbed the craggy face of Maryland Heights where he
could look directly into the center of the town. Seeing that his compatriots
were &ldquo;completely surrounded,&rdquo; he decided to try to take some of the
pressure off by firing across the river at men posted in the houses along
High Street overlooking the armory. His shot was instantly answered by a
volley of bullets that severed a branch he was clutching for support and
sent him tumbling down the rocky cliff. Badly cut and bruised from the
fall, he limped back to the schoolhouse and joined the others. Realizing
there was nothing they could do to aid their comrades trapped in the
enginehouse, they reluctantly gathered their belongings, climbed the
mountain and headed north.</p>

<p>Time was quickly running out for John Brown. As resistance became
partially organized at Harpers Ferry, steps were taken to seal off any
possibility of support reaching the raiders. Fearing that Brown&rsquo;s raid might
be part of a general uprising, all approaches to the town were guarded,
and all travelers not familiar to residents of the area were immediately
arrested and shipped off to the county jail at Charles Town.</p>
<p>As night approached, the firing sputtered out. Brown, knowing escape
was impossible, again attempted to bargain for freedom. In verbal and
written pleas he offered to release his hostages if he and his
men were allowed to leave unmolested. Col. Robert W. Taylor, now
commanding the Virginia militia units at Harpers Ferry, rejected the
offers, sending back word that if the prisoners were immediately released
he would let the Government deal with Brown and his men. But the old
abolitionist would not yield, and prisoners, slaves, and raiders alike settled
down, as best they could, to what would be a long and depressing night.</p>
<p>Brown paced up and down like a caged tiger. It had been hours since
he or any of them had tasted food or drink. The cold night air chilled
their bones and the pungent odor of gunpowder stung their nostrils. The
large-scale slave support that he had counted upon and for which the
pikes were intended had not materialized. This was largely his own doing,
however, for in his desire for absolute secrecy he had given no advance
word that he was coming. The slaves had no idea that a raid was in
progress. The few his men had picked up at the Washington and Allstadt
farms were of no use to him. They were frightened and preferred to
remain with the white hostages rather than take an active part in their own
salvation. Most likely they would not have joined him at all had they not
been taken from their homes at gunpoint.</p>
<p>From time to time Brown called out, &ldquo;Men, are you awake?&rdquo; Only
five of the raiders were still unwounded and able to hold a rifle: Brown
himself, Edwin Coppoc, J. G. Anderson, Dauphin Thompson, and Shields
Green. Stewart Taylor, the Canadian soldier of fortune, lay dead in a
corner, his presentiment of death come true. He had been shot like Oliver
Brown while standing at the enginehouse doorway. Oliver himself, writhing
in pain, begged to be killed and put out of his misery. &ldquo;If you must die,
then die like a man,&rdquo; snapped his father. After awhile Oliver was quiet.
&ldquo;I guess he is dead,&rdquo; Brown said. Nearby, Watson Brown lay quietly
breathing his last. The attack that had begun but 24 hours before was
fast coming to an end.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">THE TRAP IS SPRUNG</span></h2>
<p>The somberness that permeated the fire enginehouse contrasted sharply
with the din outside. Hundreds of militiamen and townspeople jammed the
streets, which echoed with whoops and yells. Anxious and hysterical
friends and relatives of Brown&rsquo;s hostages added to the confusion. While
the quasi-military operations ended at nightfall, the non-military activities
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
continued with increasing fervor. The bars in the Wager House and Gault
House Saloon were enjoying an unprecedented business. Many men were
intoxicated, and they fired their guns wildly into the air and occasionally at
the enginehouse. All semblance of order was gone and the &ldquo;wildest
excitement&rdquo; prevailed throughout the night.</p>

</div>
<p>During this confusion two of Brown&rsquo;s men made their escape. Of the
raiders caught in Harpers Ferry when the Jefferson Guards seized the
B &amp; O bridge at midday on October 17, Albert Hazlett and Osborn P.
Anderson, occupying the arsenal, went unnoticed during the day. At night
they crept out, mingled with the disorderly crowds, crossed the Potomac
into Maryland, and fled north.</p>
<p>Into the midst of the chaos created by the drunken and disorderly
militia and townspeople marched 90 U.S. Marines led by a 52-year-old
Army colonel, Robert E. Lee. Lee had been at his home in Arlington, Va.,
that afternoon when Lt. J. E. B. Stuart brought him secret orders to report
to the War Department at once. There President Buchanan and
Secretary of War Floyd told him of Brown&rsquo;s attack and ordered him to
leave immediately for Harpers Ferry with the only Federal troops readily
available, a detachment of Marines at the Washington Navy Yard. Upon
his arrival at Harpers Ferry, Lee was to take command of all forces in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
town. Lieutenant Stuart, scenting excitement, asked for and received
permission to accompany Lee, who, in the hurry of departure, had no time
to return home and don his uniform.</p>
<p>The Marines, under the immediate command of Lt. Israel Green, left
Washington before Lee and arrived at Sandy Hook in late afternoon. Lee
and Stuart joined them at 10:30 p.m. Marching into Harpers Ferry, the
Marines entered the armory yard about 11 p.m. and replaced the
disorganized militia. Lee would have ordered an immediate attack on the
enginehouse &ldquo;But for the fear of sacrificing the lives of some of the
gentlemen held ... as prisoners....&rdquo;</p>
<p>About 2:30 a.m., October 18, Lee wrote a surrender demand and
handed it to Stuart for delivery to Brown under a white flag when so
directed. He hoped that the raider chieftain could be persuaded to
surrender peaceably and avoid further bloodshed, but he expected that he
would be taken only by force and laid his plans accordingly. In the early
morning hours, Lee, believing the raid to be chiefly aimed against State
authority and not the Federal Government, offered the honor of assaulting
the enginehouse to Colonel Shriver of the Maryland Volunteers. Shriver
declined. &ldquo;These men of mine have wives and children,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will not
expose them to such risks. You are paid for doing this kind of work.&rdquo; Lee
then offered the task to Colonel Baylor of the Virginia militia. Baylor
promptly declined it for the same reasons. Lieutenant Green was then
asked if he wished &ldquo;the honor of taking those men out.&rdquo; Green lifted his
cap, thanked Lee, and picked a storming party of 12 men. He instructed
them to use only their bayonets, as bullets might injure some of the
hostages.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>By 7 a.m. there was enough light for operations. All arrangements for
the assault had been completed. The militia formed up outside the armory
wall to keep the street clear of spectators and to prevent indiscriminate
firing that might injure the storming party. The Marines took position
at the northwest corner of the enginehouse, just out of the line of fire from
the door. Then Lieutenant Stuart moved forward with the surrender
demand. Brown opened the door a few inches and placed his body against
the crack so the lieutenant could not see inside. He held a cocked rifle in
one hand. Stuart read the terms offered by Lee:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Colonel Lee, United States Army, commanding troops sent by the
President of the United States to suppress the insurrection at this
place, demands the surrender of the persons in the Armory buildings.
If they will peaceably surrender themselves and restore the pillaged
property, they shall be kept in safety to await the orders of the
President. Col. Lee represents to them, in all frankness, that it is
impossible for them to escape; that the Armory is surrounded on
all sides by troops; and that if he is compelled to take them by force
he cannot answer for their safety.</p>

<p>According to Stuart, the parley was &ldquo;a long one.&rdquo; Brown refused to
surrender. Instead he presented his own propositions &ldquo;in every possible
shape, and with admirable tact,&rdquo; insisting that he, his men, and his
hostages be permitted to cross the river unmolested.</p>
<p>Stuart, instructed not to accept any counter-proposals, sensed that
further discussion was useless. Stepping back from the door, he waved his
hat, a pre-arranged signal for the Marines to attack. Brown slammed the
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
door shut and the troops came on. Three men with sledge hammers
pounded the center door of the enginehouse, but it would not yield; the
raiders had placed the fire engines against it. Spotting a heavy ladder
nearby, Lieutenant Green directed his men to use it as a battering-ram. On
the second blow the door splintered and a small opening was effected.</p>

then dropped his gun and clawed his face in pain where a bullet had torn
through his cheek. The rest of the storming party entered without injury.</p>
<p>The hostages cowered at the rear of the building; Brown knelt between
the fire engines, rifle in hand. As Green came through the row of engines,
Colonel Washington greeted him and pointed at Brown. Green raised his

the back of the raider chieftain&rsquo;s neck. As Brown fell, Green lunged with
his sword, striking part of the raider&rsquo;s accouterments and bending the
blade double. Green then showered blow after blow upon Brown&rsquo;s head
until he fell unconscious. Two of the raiders were killed almost
immediately after the Marines entered the building: Dauphin Thompson,
pinned against the rear wall by a bayonet, and Jeremiah Anderson, run
through by a saber as he sought refuge under one of the fire engines.
Edwin Coppoc and Shields Green surrendered. The fight was over in
about 3 minutes.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig54">

<p class="pcap">After their capture, Brown and his surviving men were placed
under guard outside the enginehouse, where they were subjected
to taunts and threats of angry militia and townspeople.</p>
</div>
<p>None of the hostages was injured, although Lieutenant Green
considered them the &ldquo;sorriest lot of people I ever saw.&rdquo; The dead, dying,
and wounded raiders were carried outside and laid in a row on the grass.
As Brown slowly regained consciousness, the Marines had trouble keeping
back the throngs of militia and townspeople who wanted to see the
wounded raider leader. After noon, Brown and Stevens, still suffering from
the wounds he received on October 17, were carried to the paymaster&rsquo;s
office where a group of inquisitors, including Virginia&rsquo;s Governor Henry A.
Wise and Senator James M. Mason, and Ohio Congressman Clement L.
Vallandigham, questioned them for 3 hours in an effort to learn their
purpose and the names of their supporters in the North.</p>
<p>During the interrogation Brown lay on the floor, his hair matted and
tangled, his face, hands, and clothes soiled and smeared with blood. He
talked freely, and while he readily admitted his intention to free the
slaves, &ldquo;and only that,&rdquo; he refused to divulge the names of his Northern
backers. &ldquo;No man sent me here,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it was my own prompting and
that of my Maker, or that of the devil, whichever you ascribe it to. I
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
acknowledge no man in human form.&rdquo; He continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want you to understand, gentlemen ... that I respect the rights of
the poorest and weakest of colored people, oppressed by the slave
system, just as much as I do those of the most wealthy and powerful.
That is the idea that has moved me, and that alone. We expect no
reward, except the satisfaction of endeavoring to do for those in distress
and greatly oppressed, as we would be done by. The cry of distress of
the oppressed is my reason, and the only thing that has prompted
me to come here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brown then issued a prophetic warning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wish to say furthermore, that you had better&mdash;all you people at the
South&mdash;prepare yourselves for a settlement of that question that must
come up for settlement sooner than you are prepared for it. The sooner
you are prepared the better. You may dispose of me very easily; I am
nearly disposed of now; but this question is still to be settled&mdash;this
negro question I mean&mdash;the end of that is not yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">JOHN BROWN&rsquo;S BODY</span></h2>
<p>The day after their capture, Brown and his surviving followers&mdash;Stevens,
Edwin Coppoc, Shields Green, and John Copeland&mdash;were taken
to Charles Town under heavy guard and lodged in the county jail. The
cell doors had hardly banged shut when they learned that they were to
receive speedy trials. The grand jury was then in session, and the
semiannual term of the circuit court, presided over by Judge Richard
Parker, had begun.</p>
<p>The five raiders were arraigned on October 25, just one week after their
capture. The next day they were indicted for treason against the
Commonwealth of Virginia, for conspiring with slaves to rebel, and for
murder. Each defendant pleaded &ldquo;Not guilty&rdquo; and each asked for a separate
trial. The court consented and elected to try Brown first. Two court-appointed
attorneys, 36-year-old Lawson Botts, who had helped to capture
the raiders, and Thomas C. Green, the 39-year-old Mayor of Charles
Town, were called upon to defend him. Charles Harding, Commonwealth
Attorney for Jefferson County, and Andrew Hunter, a veteran Charles
Town lawyer, served as prosecutors for the State.</p>
<p>The trial began on October 27. It lasted 3&frac12; days. Still suffering from his
wounds, Brown was carried back and forth from jail to courthouse, and
lay on a cot during much of the proceedings. Judge Parker had hardly
brought the court to order when defense counsel Botts astounded the
packed courtroom (including Brown himself) by reading a telegram from
A. H. Lewis of Akron, Ohio, dated October 26:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John Brown, leader of the insurrection at Harper&rsquo;s Ferry, and several
of his family, have resided in this county for many years. Insanity is
hereditary in that family. His mother&rsquo;s sister died with it, and a
daughter of that sister has been two years in a Lunatic Asylum. A son
and daughter of his mother&rsquo;s brother have also been confined in the
lunatic asylum, and another son of that brother is now insane and
under close restraint. These facts can be conclusively proven by
witnesses residing here, who will doubtless attend the trial if desired.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>After receiving the telegram, Botts had gone to the jail to talk with Brown
about it. The raider leader had readily admitted that there were instances
of insanity in his mother&rsquo;s side of the family (in fact, his mother had died
insane), but asserted that there was none at all on his father&rsquo;s side. He
said his first wife had shown symptoms of it, as had two of their sons,
Frederick and John, Jr. Clearly, by introducing the Lewis telegram, the
defense hoped to save Brown&rsquo;s life by having him declared insane and
committed to an institution. But the old abolitionist refused to sanction
such a plea. Rising up on his cot, he exclaimed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will add, if the Court will allow me, that I look upon it as a
miserable artifice and pretext of those who ought to take a different
course in regard to me, if they took any at all, and I view it with
contempt more than otherwise. As I remarked to Mr. Green, insane
persons, so far as my experience goes, have but little ability to judge
of their own sanity; and, if I am insane, of course I should think
I know more than all the rest of the world. But I do not think so. I am
perfectly unconscious of insanity, and I reject, so far as I am capable,
any attempt to interfere in my behalf on that score.</p>

<p>Judge Parker ruled out the insanity plea on the basis that the evidence
had not been presented in a reliable form. He also rejected Bott&rsquo;s request
for a delay in the proceedings to allow new counsel of Brown&rsquo;s own
choosing to come from Ohio. The trial continued.</p>
<p>The defense lawyers were increased to three when George Hoyt joined
Botts and Green. Hoyt, a 21-year-old Boston lawyer, was sent to Charles
Town by some of Brown&rsquo;s Northern supporters ostensibly to defend the
raider chieftain; his real mission was to gather information that might be
useful to those plotting Brown&rsquo;s escape.</p>
<p>As the trial progressed, Brown became more and more irritated with his
court-appointed lawyers and openly expressed his lack of confidence in
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
them. Botts and Green thereupon withdrew, leaving Hoyt, the woefully
inexperienced &ldquo;beardless boy&rdquo; who was entirely unacquainted with the
code and procedure of the Virginia courts and knowing very little about
the case, burdened with the sole responsibility for conducting the defense
in one of the most sensational trials the country had ever witnessed. He
was soon reinforced, however, by more seasoned counsel. Samuel Chilton
of Washington, D.C., and Hiram Griswold of Cleveland, Ohio, were
persuaded by Brown&rsquo;s influential friends to join the fight to save the
abolitionist&rsquo;s life. But their arrival made little difference; the outcome of
the trial was inevitable.</p>
<p>The prosecution&rsquo;s parade of witnesses recounted the story of the attack
on Harpers Ferry, the arming of the slaves, and the deaths of Hayward
Shepherd, Fontaine Beckham, and George W. Turner. Brown&rsquo;s contention
that, as commander in chief of a provisional army, he should be tried
according to the laws of war and not as a common criminal was rejected.
Other arguments offered by the defense met with equally fruitless results.
Finally, on October 31, closing arguments by the prosecution and the
defense were heard and at 1:45 p.m. the case went to the jury.
Deliberations lasted for 45 minutes. The verdict: guilty on all three counts.
A newspaper correspondent described the reaction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not the slightest sound was heard in the vast crowd as this verdict
was thus returned and read. Not the slightest expression of elation
or triumph was uttered from the hundreds present, who, a moment
before, outside the court, joined in heaping threats and imprecations
upon his head; nor was this strange silence interrupted during the
whole of the time occupied by the forms of the Court. Old Brown
himself said not even a word, but, as on previous days, turned to
adjust his pallet, and then composedly stretched himself upon it.</p>

<p>Sentence was passed on November 2: John Brown would hang on
Friday, December 2, 1859. The other raiders&mdash;Coppoc, Stevens, Copeland,
and Green&mdash;were tried subsequently, found guilty, and received like
sentences. Of the seven raiders who escaped from Harpers Ferry, John
Cook and Albert Hazlett were captured in Pennsylvania, brought to
Charles Town for trial, convicted, and hanged.</p>
<p>In the days following Brown&rsquo;s sentencing, Virginia&rsquo;s Governor Wise
was swamped with mail. Many letters pleaded for clemency, some
contained outright threats, while others warned of fantastic plots to effect
the abolitionist&rsquo;s escape. Martial law was declared in Charles Town.
Militiamen were everywhere, and armed patrols kept a vigilant watch on
all roads leading into town. The day of execution came, and not one of the
schemes to free Brown materialized.</p>

<p><b>IN pursuance of instructions from the Governor of Virginia,
notice is hereby given to all whom it may concern,</b></p>
<p class="tb"><b>That, as heretofore, particularly from now until after Friday
next the 2nd of December, STRANGERS found within
the County of Jefferson, and Counties adjacent, having no

<p><b>That on, and for a proper period before that day, stangers[sic]

required to effect this, and during the said period and especially
on the 2nd of December, the citizens of Jefferson and the
surrounding country are <i>EMPHATICALLY</i> warned to
remain at their homes armed and guard their own property.</b></p>
</div>
<p>On the afternoon before the execution, Brown&rsquo;s grief-stricken wife was
allowed to visit him in his cell. They spent several hours talking. Toward
evening they parted, and Mary Brown went to Harpers Ferry to await
the delivery of her husband&rsquo;s body. It would be her agonizing duty to
return Brown&rsquo;s remains to their North Elba home for burial.</p>
<p>A few minutes after 11 a.m. on December 2, 1859, John Brown walked
down the steps of the Charles Town jail, climbed into the back of a
horse-drawn wagon, and sat down on his own coffin. Flanked by files of
soldiers, the wagon moved off toward a field a short distance from the town
where a scaffold had been erected. No civilians were permitted near the
execution site. The field was ringed by 1,500 soldiers, among them a
company of Virginia Military Institute cadets commanded by a stern-looking
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
professor who would soon gain fame and immortality as the
Confederate Gen. &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo; Jackson. In the ranks of a Richmond
company stood another man who, in a few short years, would also
achieve immortality by committing one of the most infamous deeds in
American history&mdash;John Wilkes Booth.</p>

<p class="pcap">With soldiers lining the streets, John Brown comes down the
steps of the Charles Town jail on the way to his execution,
December 2, 1859. The wagon containing his coffin stands
nearby.</p>
</div>
<p>As the hushed military watched, Brown climbed the scaffold steps.
Sheriff John W. Campbell pulled a white linen hood over the prisoner&rsquo;s
head and set the noose. John Avis, the jailer, asked Brown to step forward
onto the trap. &ldquo;You must lead me,&rdquo; Brown replied, &ldquo;for I cannot see.&rdquo;
The abolitionist&rsquo;s last words were directed to Avis as one final adjustment
of the noose was made. &ldquo;Be quick,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>At 11:30 a hatchet stroke sprung the trap and John Brown died. The
voice of a militia colonel broke the stillness: &ldquo;So perish all such enemies
of Virginia! All such enemies of the Union! All such enemies of the
human race!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the end was not yet. True, Brown was dead; but he had helped
to arouse popular passions both North and South to the point where
compromise would be impossible. The raid created a national furor and
generated a wave of emotionalism that widened the sectional breach that
had divided the country for so many years. Although conservative
Northern opinion quickly condemned the raid as the work of a madman,
the more radical hailed it as &ldquo;the best news America ever had&rdquo; and
glorified Brown as &ldquo;the new saint&rdquo; whose martyrdom in the cause of
human freedom would make the gallows &ldquo;glorious like the cross.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Southerners shuddered. For decades they had been defending their
&ldquo;peculiar institution&rdquo; of slavery against the ever-increasing attacks of
Northern abolitionists, but anti-slavery agitation had always followed a
course of non-violence. Then Brown had come with his pikes and guns
to change all that. In the false atmosphere of crisis that gripped the South
in the wake of the raid, the small voices of moderates were lost in the din
of extremists who saw Brown&rsquo;s act as part of a vast Northern conspiracy
to instigate servile insurrections throughout the slave States.</p>
<p>To meet this threat, real or imagined, vigilance committees were
formed, volunteer military companies were organized, and more and more
Southerners began to echo the sentiments of the Richmond Enquirer:
&ldquo;if under the form of a Confederacy our peace is disturbed, our State
invaded, its peaceful citizens cruelly murdered ... by those who should
be our warmest friends ... and the people of the North sustain the
outrage, then let disunion come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disunion sentiment increased during the presidential campaign of
1860, stimulated by a split in the Democratic Party that practically
guaranteed a Republican victory in the November elections. When
Abraham Lincoln was elected President, the secessionist movement could
no longer be contained. On December 20, unable to tolerate a President
&ldquo;whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery,&rdquo; South Carolina
severed her ties with the Union. By February 1, 1861, Mississippi, Florida,
Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas had followed her lead. One week
later the Confederate States of America was formed at Montgomery, Ala.,
and the country drifted slowly toward civil war. Before many months had
passed, soldiers in blue would be marching south to the tune of &ldquo;John
Brown&rsquo;s Body&rdquo; as if to fulfill the prophecy Brown had left in a note to one
of his Charles Town guards shortly before the execution:</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">EPILOGUE</span></h2>
<p>The war that John Brown predicted would come, and which his raid
helped to precipitate, began in April 1861. When it ended almost 4 years
to the day later, slavery had been destroyed along with some 600,000
lives and millions of dollars worth of property. Among the casualties of
the war was Harpers Ferry. The town&rsquo;s strategic position on the Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad at the northern end of the Shenandoah Valley made
it a prime target for both Union and Confederate forces. It changed
hands again and again, and by war&rsquo;s end in 1865 the place was a shambles.</p>
<p>As early as February 1862 a young Union staff officer assigned to
the Harpers Ferry area could write of the town: &ldquo;The appearance of ruin
by war and fire was awful. Charred ruins were all that remain of the
splendid public works, arsenals, workshops and railroads, stores, hotels,
and dwelling houses all mingled in one common destruction.&rdquo; Much the
same observation was made 3 years later in the summer of 1865 by John
T. Trowbridge, a New England writer, during a tour of the South: &ldquo;[T]he
town is the reverse of agreeable. It is said to have been a pleasant and
picturesque place formerly. The streets were well graded, and the hill-sides
above were graced with terraces and trees. But war has changed all.
Freshets tear down the centre of the streets, and the hill-sides present
only ragged growths of weeds. The town itself lies half in ruins.... Of the
bridge across the Shenandoah only the ruined piers are left; still less
remains of the old bridge over the Potomac. And all about the town are
rubbish, filth and stench.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The once-imposing armory complex along the Potomac River and the
rifle works on Hall Island in the Shenandoah were burned-out hulks.
Only the armory enginehouse remained basically intact, &ldquo;like a monument
which no Rebel hands were permitted to demolish.&rdquo; Large sections of the
town had been burned by various troop contingents to prevent their use by
enemy soldiers. Many homes, churches, schools, and business establishments
were damaged beyond repair by shot and shell fired from the
surrounding heights. Still other buildings, subjected to long military use,
were on the verge of ruin. The industries on Virginius Island&mdash;the iron
foundry, the flour mill, the sawmill, the machine shops, the cotton mill&mdash;were
also gone, and Harpers Ferry no longer had the activity and bustle
of an economically healthy community.</p>
<p>Besides the material damage inflicted by powerful weaponry and by
the seemingly endless procession of soldiers who filched or requisitioned
everything that could be carried away, the town suffered an even greater
loss&mdash;its people. During the war most of the townspeople moved away,
some to escape the dangers of military operations, some to seek employment
elsewhere after the armory and the industries were destroyed, and
some to join one or the other opposing armies. Many never came back.
Those who did return found their town in ruins and themselves the
citizens of a new State.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>In 1861 the people in the mountainous western counties of Virginia
strongly opposed secession. When the rest of the State voted overwhelmingly
in a statewide referendum on May 23, 1861, to withdraw from the
Federal Union, the loyal western residents, in a series of conventions at
Wheeling, voted to &ldquo;secede&rdquo; from Virginia and set up their own State. The
bill for admission passed Congress on December 11, 1862, and on June 30,
1863, by Presidential proclamation, West Virginia became the 35th State.
For years, however, many Jefferson County residents refused to use
&ldquo;West&rdquo; as part of the designation.</p>
<p>Harpers Ferry never recovered from the devastation of the Civil War.
Staring at the stark chimneys and charred remains of once impressive
buildings, one of the townspeople concluded: &ldquo;This place will never be
anything again unless the government rebuilds the armory&mdash;and it is
doubtful if that is ever done.&rdquo; The Government never did, and the ground
on which it stood was auctioned off in 1869. Mills and factories remained
closed. The railroad did a small percentage of its previous business. Hopes
for a renewal of the town&rsquo;s former prosperity were dashed in 1870 when
a flood destroyed or badly damaged nearly every building on Virginius
Island and along the south side of Shenandoah Street. Subsequent floods
destroyed still more of the town and ruined the Chesapeake and Ohio
Canal. The canal was finally abandoned after the flood of 1924.</p>
<p>Inundated too often by high water, the residents of Harpers Ferry
eventually left the old buildings in the lower town and moved up the
heights to the high ground of Camp Hill and toward Bolivar. For years
the old shops and stores, those that remained, stood empty, neglected, and
deteriorating. When Harpers Ferry became a national historical area, the
National Park Service began an intensive campaign to preserve the fragile
remains of the 18th- and 19th-century industries, homes, churches, stores,
and shops, and to restore much of the old town to its pre-Civil War
appearance, a time when it was at its peak as a thriving, bustling
industrial community and transportation center.</p>
<p>Today, while much of the old historical town remains, few of the
structures that figured prominently in John Brown&rsquo;s raid survive. (See
maps on pp. <a class="pgref" href="#Page_29">29</a> and <a class="pgref" href="#Page_30">30</a>.) The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad bridge across the
Potomac, by which Brown and his raiders entered Harpers Ferry in
October 1859, was destroyed by Confederate soldiers early in the Civil
War. More modern structures span the river now, but the stone supports
of the old bridge can still be seen. Nothing at all remains of the bridge
across the Shenandoah. The stone piers now standing in the river near the
Point section of the town are from a later structure.</p>
<p>The ruins of the armory buildings stood for many years after the war
and eventually disappeared. In 1893 the site itself disappeared under 30
feet of fill when the B &amp; O Railroad changed the line of its tracks. The
outlines of two of the armory buildings have been marked by flat stones
and the spot where the enginehouse was located is marked by a small
monument. The enginehouse itself (now called &ldquo;John Brown&rsquo;s Fort&rdquo;)
stands nearby on the old arsenal grounds, and is little changed from its
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
appearance at the time of the raid. Here also can be seen the excavated
remains of the small U.S. arsenal and some of the partially exposed burned
muskets destroyed when the building was gutted by Federal troops in
April 1861.</p>
<p>In February 1862 Federal soldiers burned the Point area of Harpers
Ferry to keep Confederate sharpshooters from using the buildings. Among
the structures destroyed were the railroad depot, the water tower around
which Mayor Fontaine Beckham was peering when he was shot by one of
the raiders, several stores and shops, the Potomac Restaurant, the Wager
House Hotel, and the Gault House Saloon. The Wager House (not to be
confused with another structure of the same name that still exists) was
the scene of several notable events. It was here that many of the wounded
were carried, including two of the raiders, Aaron Stevens and William
Thompson. Many of the militiamen did their &ldquo;best fighting&rdquo; at its bar.
From the Wager House porch, Gov. Henry Wise of Virginia read letters
taken from Brown&rsquo;s men to the angered townspeople. Wise also lived here
during his brief stay in Harpers Ferry. Mrs. John Brown stayed here when
she came to Harpers Ferry in December 1859 for her last visit with her
husband, and it was here that she received his body after the execution.</p>
<p>The Shenandoah islands are deserted today except for the line of the
Winchester and Potomac Railroad. All of the buildings are gone now
except for the foundations of some of the mills and the retaining walls of
the rifle factory, nestled in among the weeds, brush, and trees. Many
disappeared through neglect after the industries were destroyed during the
Civil War, some washed away in the many floods with which Harpers
Ferry has been plagued, and others, like Herr&rsquo;s flour mill and the rifle
works, were deliberately destroyed by Union and Confederate troops.</p>
<p>Several structures associated with the raid still exist outside Harpers
Ferry. The courthouse at Charles Town, W. Va., is little changed since
John Brown was tried and sentenced there more than a century ago. The
Kennedy farm, Brown&rsquo;s headquarters during the months he was planning
the raid, lies in the Maryland countryside about 5 miles from Harpers
Ferry. Col. Lewis Washington&rsquo;s home, &ldquo;Beallair,&rdquo; which several raiders
broke into on the night of October 16 and took its owner hostage, stands
near Halltown, about 4 miles west of Harpers Ferry. And nearby, at the
foot of Alstadt Hill, west of Bolivar, is the home of John H. Alstadt,
another hostage taken by Brown&rsquo;s men on October 16.</p>

<br />The Capture of John Brown<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
<br />by Israel Green</h2>
<p>At noon of Monday, October 18, 1859, Chief Clerk Walsh, of the Navy
Department, drove rapidly into the Washington Navy-yard, and, meeting
me, asked me how many marines we had stationed at the barracks
available for immediate duty. I happened to be the senior officer present
and in command that day. I instantly replied to Mr. Walsh that we had
ninety men available, and then asked him what was the trouble. He told
me that Ossawatomie Brown, of Kansas, with a number of men, had taken
the arsenal at Harper&rsquo;s Ferry, and was then besieged there by the Virginia
State troops. Mr. Walsh returned speedily to the Navy Department
building, and, in the course of an hour, orders came to me from
Secretary Tousey to proceed at once to Harper&rsquo;s Ferry and report to the
senior officer; and, if there should be no such officer at the Ferry, to take
charge and protect the government property. With a detachment of ninety
marines, I started for Harper&rsquo;s Ferry that afternoon on the 3:30 train,
taking with me two howitzers. It was a beautiful, clear autumn day, and
the men, exhilarated by the excitement of the occasion, which came after
a long, dull season of confinement in the barracks, enjoyed the trip
exceedingly.</p>
<p>At Frederick Junction I received a dispatch from Colonel Robert E.
Lee, who turned out to be the army officer to whom I was to report. He
directed me to proceed to Sandy Hook, a small place about a mile this
side of the Ferry, and there await his arrival. At ten o&rsquo;clock in the evening
he came up on a special train from Washington. His first order was to
form the marines out of the car, and march from the bridge to Harper&rsquo;s
Ferry. This we did, entering the enclosure of the arsenal grounds through
a back gate. At eleven o&rsquo;clock Colonel Lee ordered the volunteers to march
out of the grounds, and gave the control inside to the marines, with
instructions to see that none of the insurgents escaped during the night.
There had been hard fighting all the preceding day, and Brown and his
men kept quiet during the night. At half-past six in the morning Colonel
Lee gave me orders to select a detail of twelve men for a storming party,
and place them near the engine-house in which Brown and his men had
intrenched themselves. I selected twelve of my best men, and a second
twelve to be employed as a reserve. The engine-house was a strong stone
[actually brick] building, which is still in a good state of preservation at
the Ferry, in spite of the three days&rsquo; fighting in the building by Brown and
his men, and the ravages of the recent war between the States. The building
was ... perhaps thirty feet by thirty-five. In the front were two large
double doors, between which was a stone abutment. Within were two
old-fashioned, heavy fire-engines, with a hose-cart and reel standing
between them, and just back of the abutment between the doors. They were
double-battened doors, very strongly made, with heavy wrought-iron nails.
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
Lieutenant J. E. B. Stewart [Stuart], afterwards famous as a cavalry
commander on the side of the South, accompanied Colonel Lee as a
volunteer aid. He was ordered to go with a part of the troops to the front
of the engine-house and demand the surrender of the insurgent party.
Colonel Lee directed him to offer protection to Brown and his men, but to
receive no counter-proposition from Brown in regard to the surrender.
On the way to the engine-house, Stewart and myself agreed upon a signal
for attack in the event that Brown should refuse to surrender. It was
simply that Lieutenant Stewart would wave his hat, which was then, I
believe, one very similar to the famous chapeau which he wore throughout
the war. I had my storming party ranged alongside of the engine-house,
and a number of men were provided with sledge-hammers with which to
batter in the doors. I stood in front of the abutment between the
doors. Stewart hailed Brown and called for his surrender, but Brown at
once began to make a proposition that he and his men should be allowed
to come out of the engine-house and be given the length of the bridge
start, so that they might escape. Suddenly Lieutenant Stewart waved his
hat, and I gave the order to my men to batter in the door. Those
inside fired rapidly at the point where the blows were given upon the door.
Very little impression was made with the hammers, as the doors were
tied on the inside with ropes and braced by the hand-brakes of the fire-engines,
and in a few minutes I gave the order to desist. Just then
my eye caught sight of a ladder, lying a few feet from the engine-house,
in the yard, and I ordered my men to catch it up and use it as a
battering-ram. The reserve of twelve men I employed as a supporting
column for the assaulting party. The men took hold bravely and made a
tremendous assault upon the door. The second blow broke it in.
This entrance was a ragged hole low down in the right-hand door, the
door being splintered and cracked some distance upward. I instantly
stepped from my position in front of the stone abutment, and entered the
opening made by the ladder. At the time I did not stop to think of
it, but upon reflection I should say that Brown had just emptied his
carbine at the point broken by the ladder, and so I passed in safely.
Getting to my feet, I ran to the right of the engine which stood behind the
door, passed quickly to the rear of the house, and came up between
the two engines. The first person I saw was Colonel Lewis Washington,
who was standing near the hose-cart, at the front of the engine-house.
On one knee, a few feet to the left, knelt a man with a carbine in his hand,
just pulling the lever to reload.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Green,&rdquo; said Colonel Washington, and he reached out his
hand to me. I grasped it with my left hand, having my saber uplifted in
my right, and he said, pointing to the kneeling figure, &ldquo;This is
Ossawatomie.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>As he said this, Brown turned his head to see who it was to whom
Colonel Washington was speaking. Quicker than thought I brought my
saber down with all my strength upon his head. He was moving as
the blow fell, and I suppose I did not strike him where I intended, for he
received a deep saber cut in the back of the neck. He fell senseless on
his side, then rolled over on his back. He had in his hand a short Sharpe&rsquo;s-cavalry
carbine. I think he had just fired as I reached Colonel
Washington, for the marine who followed me into the aperture made by
the ladder received a bullet in the abdomen, from which he died in a
few minutes. The shot might have been fired by some one else in the
insurgent party, but I think it was from Brown. Instinctively as Brown fell
I gave him a saber thrust in the left breast. The sword I carried was a
light uniform weapon, and, either not having a point or striking something
hard in Brown&rsquo;s accouterments, did not penetrate. The blade bent double.</p>
<p>By that time three or four of my men were inside. They came
rushing in like tigers, as a storming assault is not a play-day sport. They
bayoneted one man skulking under the engine, and pinned another
fellow up against the rear wall, both being instantly killed. I ordered the
men to spill no more blood. The other insurgents were at once taken
under arrest, and the contest ended. The whole fight had not lasted over
three minutes. My only thought was to capture, or, if necessary, kill,
the insurgents, and take possession of the engine-house.</p>
<p>I saw very little of the situation within until the fight was over. Then
I observed that the engine-house was thick with smoke, and it was
with difficulty that a person could be seen across the room. In the rear,
behind the left-hand engine, were huddled the prisoners whom Brown
had captured and held as hostages for the safety of himself and his
men. Colonel Washington was one of these. All during the fight, as I
understood afterward, he kept to the front of the engine-house. When I
met him he was as cool as he would have been on his own veranda
entertaining guests. He was naturally a very brave man. I remember that
he would not come out of the engine-house, begrimed and soiled as
he was from his long imprisonment, until he had put a pair of kid gloves
upon his hands. The other prisoners were the sorriest lot of people I
ever saw. They had been without food for over sixty hours, in constant
dread of being shot, and were huddled up in the corner where lay the
body of Brown&rsquo;s son and one or two others of the insurgents who had been
killed. Some of them have endeavored to give an account of the storming
of the engine-house and the capture of Brown, but none of the reports
have been free from a great many misstatements, and I suppose that
Colonel Washington and myself were the only persons really able to say
what was done. Other stories have been printed by people on the outside,
describing the fight within. What they say must be taken with a great
deal of allowance, for they could not have been witnesses of what
occurred within the engine-house. One recent account describes me as
jumping over the right-hand engine more like a wild beast than a
soldier. Of course nothing of the kind happened. The report made by
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
Colonel Lee at the time, which is now on file in the War department,
gives a more succinct and detailed account than any I have seen.</p>
<p>I can see Colonel Lee now, as he stood on a slight elevation about
forty feet from the engine-house, during the assault. He was in civilian
dress, and looked then very little as he did during the war. He wore no
beard, except a dark mustache, and his hair was slightly gray. He had no
arms upon his person, and treated the affair as one of no very great
consequence, which would be speedily settled by the marines. A part of the
scene, giving color and life to the picture, was the bright blue uniform
of the marines. They wore blue trousers then, as they do now, and a dark-blue
frock-coat. Their belts were white, and they wore French fatigue
caps. I do not remember the names of the twelve men in the storming
party, nor can I tell what became of them in later life. We had no use for
the howitzers, and, in fact, they were not taken from the car.</p>
<p>Immediately after the fight, Brown was carried out of the engine-house,
and recovered consciousness while lying on the ground in front. A
detail of men carried him up to the paymaster&rsquo;s office, where he was
attended to and his wants supplied. On the following day, Wednesday,
with an escort, I removed him to Charleston [Charles Town], and
turned him over to the civil authorities. No handcuffs were placed upon
him, and he supported himself with a self-reliance and independence
which were characteristic of the man. He had recovered a great deal from
the effects of the blow from my saber, the injury of which was
principally the shock, as he only received a flesh wound. I had little
conversation with him, and spent very little time with him.</p>
<p>I have often been asked to describe Brown&rsquo;s appearance at the instant
he lifted his head to see who was talking with Colonel Washington. It
would be impossible for me to do so. The whole scene passed so rapidly
that it hardly made a distinct impression upon my mind. I can only
recall the fleeting picture of an old man kneeling with a carbine in his
hand, with a long gray beard falling away from his face, looking quickly
and keenly toward the danger that he was aware had come upon
him. He was not a large man, being perhaps five feet ten inches when he
straightened up in full. His dress, even, I do not remember distinctly.
I should say that he had his trousers tucked in his boots, and that he wore
clothes of gray&mdash;probably no more than trousers and shirt. I think he
had no hat upon his head.</p>
<p>None of the prisoners were hurt. They were badly frightened and
somewhat starved. I received no wounds except a slight scratch on one
hand as I was getting through the hole in the door. Colonel Lee and the
people on the outside thought I was wounded. Brown had, at the
time, only five or six fighting men, and I think he himself was the only
one who showed fight after I entered the engine-house. There were no
provisions in the building, and it would have been only a question of time
when Brown would have had to surrender. Colonel Washington was
the only person inside the house that I knew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>I have been asked what became of Brown&rsquo;s carbine. That I do not
know. My sword was left in Washington, among people with whom I
lived, and I lost trace of it. A few years ago, after having come out of the
war and gone west to Dakota, where I now live, I received a letter
from a gentleman in Washington, saying that he knew where the sword
was, and that it was still bent double, as it was left by the thrust upon
Brown&rsquo;s breast. He said that it was now a relic of great historic value, and
asked me to assent to the selling of it upon the condition that I should
receive a portion of the price of the weapon. To me the matter had very
little interest, and I replied indifferently. Since then I have heard
nothing of the matter. I presume the saber could be found somewhere in
Washington.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
